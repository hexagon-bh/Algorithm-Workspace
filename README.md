- 📝 **[Reverse String](https://github.com/username/repository)** - Reversing strings using different approaches.
- 📝 **[Palindrome Check](https://github.com/username/repository)** - Checking if a string is a palindrome.

### 🟠 Medium Problems
- 📝 **[Merge Intervals](https://github.com/username/repository)** - Sorting and merging intervals efficiently.
- 📝 **[Subarray Sum](https://github.com/username/repository)** - Finding subarrays that sum to a given number.

### 🔴 Hard Problems
- 📝 **[Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://github.com/username/repository)** - A more complex problem requiring dynamic programming.
- 📝 **[Word Ladder](https://github.com/username/repository)** - Finding the shortest transformation sequence from one word to another.
